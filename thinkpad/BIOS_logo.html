  <h2>How to Create and install a custom bios logo on a Thinkpad</h2>
  <p>
*This guide only covers how to perform this process from within windows.
Step 1: determine the requirements for the image
BIOS logos for ThinkPads have a variety of different requirements based upon the model and/or
display resolution. Begin by checking the logo requirements of your ThinkPad (here)
https://wilkgr76.github.io/tp_logo/ or you can download the bios and look for the file README.txt
or BIOS_LOGO.txt which will contain the image requirements
Step 2: creating the image
Based on the requirements for the image determined in step 1, use a raster graphics
editor such as Photoshop or GIMP to create the logo of you choosing. Ensure that the
canvas is set to the correct size, and remember to export in one of the supported file
types for your model of Thinkpad.
Tips to reduce the file size:
- Reduce the number of colours in the image
- Index colours to the absolute minimum needed for the image
- If possible, export the image as a .gif
Step 3: installing the image
Begin by visiting www.pcsupport.lenovo.com (for models 20 generation and newer) or
www.download.lenovo.com/eol/ (for models 10 generation and older) and navigate to
the page for your laptop. Next, download the latest bios update,
*Note: if you are already on the latest bios version, you may have to disable secure
rollback prevention in the bios
For windows:
1. Run the .exe file that was downloaded
2. When asked if you want to extract or install, select Extract Only
3. click through the rest of the program
4. Navigate to C:\DRIVERS\FLASH and open the folder for the bios version that
you installed
5. On some versions, the files may be contained in a subfolder that needs to be
opened.
6. Copy in the logo that you created, and rename it to LOGO
7. To install the bios, on a 32 bit system run winuptp.exe and on a 64 bit system
winuptp64.exe
8. If the image is properly placed in the folder, you should see a popup asking if you
want to apply a custom bios logo, click yes and update the bios
9. Congratulations, you have installed a custom bios logo!
