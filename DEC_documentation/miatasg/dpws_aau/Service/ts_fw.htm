<h3>Firmware Troubleshooting</H3>

<P>The DIGITAL Personal Workstation <EM>a/au-Series</EM> flashROM contains the SRM console firmware system, which supports the DIGITAL UNIX and OpenVMS systems.
The SRM firmware does not contain diagnostics.  (Manufacturing has a superset of the 
SRM firmware, which contains loadable diagnostics to support their environment.) </P>


<P>The firmware is typically loaded by POST code's flash loader.  If 
the flashROM is corrupted, or the checksum verification failed, the POST 
flash loader will fail.  If a power failure occurs while the firmware was being updated, it 
could corrupt the contents of the flashROM.
When the system is powered on, the POST code, sensing the flashROM corruption, will 
attempt to load from the floppy drive. Other problems and solutions follow:</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TH>Possible Cause</TH><TH>Action</TH></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>SRM POST countdown display fails to appear.</TD>
<TD>Hit the [Return] key a few times.  If the >>> prompt appears on the monitor, the 
console variable is set to serial.  Type <STRONG>set console graphics</STRONG>,
 then type<STRONG> init</STRONG>.  The countdown should now be displayed.  
The console variable is stored in the flashROM.  If the flashROM gets cleared, 
the console variable will be set to serial.</TD></TR>
	
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>SRM POST countdown displays, then the system hangs. 
Sometimes pressing the reset button results in the >>> prompt.</TD>
<TD>Try booting the system and setting the clock.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Unable to get to the console prompt (>>>)</TD>
<TD>The system is set to autoboot; try the following:
<BR>1.  Type [Ctrl]+[C] during POST testing.
<BR>2.  Type [Ctrl]+[P] before the windowing system is up.
<BR>3.  Disconnect the disk.
<BR>Once you are at the prompt, type: <STRONG>set auto_action halt</STRONG> 
to prevent autobooting.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Monitor is unreadable.</TD>
<TD>Check to see if the monitor requires the sync signal on the green signal. If it does,
get a multisync monitor.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>AlphaBIOS does not start.</TD>
<TD>Check that the keyboard is plugged in and the video controller and monitor are 
properly connected and working.  If the keyboard or video is missing or not 
functioning, AlphaBIOS sends information to the COM1 port.</TD></TR>
