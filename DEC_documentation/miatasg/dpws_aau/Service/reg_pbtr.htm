Address: 87.5000.0A00 - 87.5000.0BC0<BR>
The bank timing registers allow for the specific setup of the memory 
modules.  The register allows mixing of memory DIMMs.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>SLOW_<BR>PRECHARGE</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;5&gt;RW</TD>
<TD>When set, precharge operations are delayed for one cycle more than needed for 
the next CAS cycle.  Some vendor SDRAMS (for example, NEC) require this when operating 
with a CAS latency of 3.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>TOSHIBA</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;4&gt;RW</TD>
<TD>Toshiba SDRAMS do not permit a new CAS during several odd cycles 
after CAS.  This bit is provided for these devices. Note that the 
operation of this function is implemented by forcing auto-precharge.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Reserved<BR>_ENABLE</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;3&gt;RO</TD>
<TD>Enable subbanks. When set, subbanks are enabled and determined 
according to the BANK_SIZE table. When clear, subbanks are disabled, and 
the memRASB_I pins will be asserted only during refreshes.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>ROW_ADDR<BR>_HOLD</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;2:0&gt;RW</TD>
<TD>The minimum number of sysClk cycles that RAS will be asserted before 
CAS is asserted.
