<h3>SRM Deposit Command</H3>
<P>
<HR>
<BR>
<B>deposit</B> [<B>-</B>{<B>b,w,l,q,o,h</B>}] [<B>-</B>{<B>n</B> <EM>value</EM>, <EM>s value</EM>}] [<EM>space:</EM>] <EM>address data
</EM>
<HR>
<P>
The <B>deposit</B> command stores data in the location specified. 
<P>
If no options are given with a <B>deposit</B> command, the system uses the options from the preceding <B>deposit</B> command.
<P>
If the specified value is too large to fit in the data size listed, the console ignores the command and issues an error response.  If the data is smaller than the data size, the higher-order bits are filled with zeros.  

<P>
For data lengths longer than a longword, each longword of data should be separated by a space.

<UL>
  <LI><B>-b</B>:           	      Defines data size as                                     byte.		
  <LI><B>-w</B>:                     Defines data size as word.
  <LI><B>-l</B>(default):            Defines data size as longword.
  <LI><B>-q </B>:                    Defines data size as quadword.
  <LI><B>-o</B>:				Defines data size as                                                                    octaword.	
  <LI><B>-h</B>:                     Defines data size as hexword.
  <LI><B>-d</B>:                     Instruction decode
  <LI><B>-n</B> <EM>value</EM>:      The number of consecutive                                     locations to modify.	                                                                  <LI><B>-s</B> <EM>value</EM>:        The address increment size.  The                                                                         default is the data size.
  <LI><EM>space:</EM>				Device name (or address space)
						of the device to access.
  <LI><EM>address</EM>:			      Offset within a device to which data is deposited.  Can be:
<UL>
  <LI>dev_name: A device name.  
  <LI>fpr-name: The floating-point register set; name is F0 to F31.
  <LI>gpr-name: The general register set; name is R0 to R31.
  <LI>ipr-name: The internal processor registers.
  <LI>pt-name:  The PALtemp register set; name is PT0 to PT23.
  <LI>pmem: Physical memory (default).
  <LI>vmem: Virtual memory.
</UL>
<LI><EM>data</EM>:                            Data to be deposited.
<P>
Symbolic forms can be used for the address.  They are:
<UL>
  <LI><B>pc</B>: The program counter.  The address space is set to GPR.
  <LI><B>+</B>: The location immediately following the last location referenced in a command.  For physical and virtual memory, the referenced location is the last location plus the size of the reference (1 for byte, 2 for word, 4 for longword).  For other address spaces, the address is the last referenced address plus 1.

  <LI><B>-</B>: The location immediately preceding the last location referenced in a command.  Memory and other address spaces are handled as described earlier.
  <LI><B>*</B>: The last location referenced in a command.
  <LI><B>@</B>: The location addressed by the last location referenced in a command.
</UL>
