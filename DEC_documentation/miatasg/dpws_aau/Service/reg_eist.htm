<TR><TD COLSPAN=3>Address: IPR CBU, FF.FFF0.0168<BR>
The EI_STAT register is a read-only register.  Fill data from Bcache or main memory could 
have correctable or uncorrectable errors.  System address/command parity errors are 
treated as uncorrectable hard errors.  The register is locked on the first uncorrectable error.  
The register bits are locked until the EI_STAT register is read.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>SEO_HRD_ERR</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;35&gt;R</TD>
<TD>Set when an errors occurs while one of the error bits in this register is set already.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>FIL_IRD</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;34&gt;R</TD>
<TD>When set, this bit indicates that the error occurred during an I-ref fill.  
When clear, the error occurred during a D-ref fill.  This bit is meaningful only when an 
ECC error bit is set.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>EI_PAR_ERR</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;33&gt;R</TD>
<TD>When set, an address/command received by the CPU had a parity error.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>UNC_ECC_ERR</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;32&gt;R</TD>
<TD>When set, fill data received from outside the CPU contained an uncorrectable 
ECC error.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>COR_ECC_ERR</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;31&gt;R</TD>
<TD>When set, fill data received from outside the CPU contained a correctable ECC error.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>EI_ES</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;30&gt;R</TD>
<TD>When set, this bit indicates that the error source is fill data from main memory 
or a system address/command parity error.  When clear, the error source is fill data 
from the Bcache.  This bit is meaningful only when COR_ECC_ERR, UNC_ECC_ERR, 
or EI_PAR_ERR is set.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>BC_TC_PERR</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;29&gt;R</TD>
<TD>Indicates that a Bcache read transaction encountered bad parity in the tag 
control RAM.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>BC_TPERR</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;28&gt;R</TD>
<TD>Indicates that a Bcache read transaction encountered bad parity in the tag 
address RAM.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>CHIP_ID&lt;3:0&gt;</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;27:24&gt;R</TD>
