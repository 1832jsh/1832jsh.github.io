The state of the history buffer determines whether a row is deactivated. The history buffer remembers (for each of the last four requests to a subbank) whether the new row was the same as the old row. The four-bit history is used as an index into the Row History Policy 
Register to determine whether to deactivate  the row at the end of the transaction. If the 
RHPR is set to all 1's, then the row is always left active. If the RHPR is set to all 0's, 
then the row is always deactivated at the end of the transaction. There are 65,534 other 
possible policies, most of which are useless. <BR><BR>
To activate a row for an individual bank, the RAS signal is asserted, along with the 
appropriate CS pin. For refresh, CS is asserted for all banks simultaneously.
