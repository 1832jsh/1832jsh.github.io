<h3>Windows NT Installation</H3>

<P>
In order to install Windows NT, a system partition must be defined. On an <EM>a/au-Series</EM> system, 
a system partition is set silently in the background by AlphaBIOS when you install 
Windows NT initially.</P>

<P>The purpose of the system partition is twofold. First, it tells the Windows NT installation 
program where to place the OS Loader and hardware support files. Second, upon 
subsequent restarts of Windows NT, the system partition definition tells AlphaBIOS 
where the OSLOADER.EXE file is so it can successfully hand off control to the OS Loader 
and continue the boot process.</P>

<P>The system partition can be the same partition into which Windows NT is installed, or it 
can be separate. However, the system partition must be formatted with the FAT file system. 
Because the default recommended partition arrangement on <EM>au-Series</EM> calls for the partition into which Windows NT is installed to be an NTFS partition, the system partition will almost always be a small (4 to 6 MB) FAT partition on the same disk onto which 
Windows NT is installed. </P>

<H3>Understanding How AlphaBIOS Works with System Partitions</H3>

<P>If you have previously installed Windows NT on your system, then a system partition 
will have been defined already and Windows NT will know where to place the OSLOADER 
and hardware support files. However, if you are installing Windows NT for the first time, 
AlphaBIOS will determine that a system partition has not been defined when you select 
"Install Windows NT" in the AlphaBIOS Setup screen. When this occurs, AlphaBIOS 
searches for all FAT partitions on the system. If only one FAT partition exists (which 
would be the situation if only one hard drive is installed and you have just performed 
an express hard-disk setup), then AlphaBIOS designates that FAT partition as the system 
partition and continues with the Windows NT installation. If more than one FAT partition 
exists on your system, AlphaBIOS displays the list of FAT partitions from which you can 
choose the system partition. After choosing the system partition, the installation process 
continues.</P>

If you have a system with Windows NT preinstalled, Windows NT setup 
will start automatically the first time you power-up your system. If your system does 
not have Windows NT preinstalled, you must have a CD-ROM drive attached to your 
system to install Windows NT.

<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Steps 1 and 2 are necessary only when you are first 
setting up your system. On subsequent installations and upgrades, begin at Step 3.
To install Windows NT from CD-ROM for the first time:

<OL>
<LI>Use CMOS Setup to set the system date and time: start AlphaBIOS Setup, select 
CMOS Setup, and press [Enter].
<LI>Perform an express hard-disk setup: return to the main AlphaBIOS Setup screen, 
select Hard Disk Setup, and press [Enter].
<LI>Put the Windows NT CD into the CD-ROM drive.
<LI>Start AlphaBIOS Setup, select Install Windows NT, and press [Enter].
<LI>Follow the prompts to complete the installation. For more information on installing 
Windows NT, refer to the Installation Guide in your Windows NT software package.
