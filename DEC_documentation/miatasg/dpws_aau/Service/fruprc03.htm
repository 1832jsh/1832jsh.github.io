<CENTER><P><B>MLB/Cache Replacement</B></P></CENTER>
<P>To remove the MLB, shut down the system, remove power, 
remove the system cover, refer to the figure, and perform the following procedure:</P>
<STRONG>NOTE: </STRONG>Configuration information stored in the flashROM and TOY on the MLB
will be lost when the MLB is replaced. If possible, record the information on paper while 
displaying it with the firmware.
<OL>.
<LI>Remove the cables from the rear of the MLB (COM1, COM2, mouse, keyboard, and parallel).</LI>
<LI>Remove the left side cover by lifting it upward.</LI>
<LI>Remove the MLB-retaining bracket. (This bracket is for shipping and can be discarded.)</LI>
<LI>Pull the MLB-ejector handles upward to pull the board out of the riser card connectors.</LI>
<LI>Pull the MLB the rest of the way out of the system. The EMI shielding at the rear 
may make the board snug.</LI>
<LI>Remove the <A HREF="frufig3a.htm" target="fru_fig">cache module</A> by gently pulling
it out of the four cache connectors.  To reinstall the cache module, rest the MLB on a flat 
surface. Use the alignment pins on the MLB as a guide to position the cache onto the 
connectors.  Firmly press down the cache module to engage the connectors.</LI>
<LI>Transfer the <A HREF="fru_04.htm" target="fru_top">memory DIMMs</A> to the replacement MLB.</LI>
<LI>With the handles in the upright position, carefully insert the new MLB into the 
chassis. Guide the board into the channel at the rear and the card edge guide at the front.</LI>
<LI>While ensuring the connector edge of the MLB is aligned with the riser card 
connector, press the MLB handles down to seat the board.</LI>
<LI>If you choose to replace the MLB-retaining bracket, ensure that it is placed 
over the front dimple; <EM>otherwise, the MLB may be damaged.</EM> </LI>
<LI>Replace the left side cover.</LI>
<LI>Reattach the cables you  removed earlier.</LI>
<LI>Power up the system, and, using the firmware, enter the information you 
recorded earlier.</LI>
</OL>
