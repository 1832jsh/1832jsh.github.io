<H3>README for the DIGITAL Personal Workstation <EM>a/au-Series</EM> System Reference and Maintenance Guide (AK-XXXXX-XX)
</H3>

<P>The DIGITAL Personal Workstation <EM>a/au-Series</EM> System Reference and Maintenance Guide is a frame-based HTML
document.  It contains an overview of the system as well as instructions on configuring, 
troubleshooting, replacing FRUs, finding part numbers, and using the firmware.</P>

<P>The initial page for the service guide is \dpws_aau\service\Aaudpwssg.htm. This file should always be loaded first to ensure correct operation of the guide.</P>

<H3>HOW TO PRINT FRAMES</H3>
<P>To print displayed information, select the frame you want to print by clicking on the 
frame in a "cold" spot (any spot that's not hot). You should notice a thin outline appear 
around the frame's outer edge.  From the File menu, select the Print Frame menu item. 
The command lets you print only the page of a currently selected frame. This was tested 
with Netscape Navigator.</P>
