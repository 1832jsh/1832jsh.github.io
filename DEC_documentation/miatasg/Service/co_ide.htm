<H3>IDE Configuration</H3>
</HEAD>
<P>The DIGITAL Personal Workstation <EM>a/au-Series </EM>system uses the PCI-ISA bridge chip to provide an Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) interface to two 16-bit channels.  Most of the connections are made on pins that are used for ISA bus transactions as well.
<P>
The interface can support up to two devices, drive 0 and drive 1, on each channel (primary and secondary).  Each channel has a separate connector on the riser card.  Note that the two channels are not truly electrically separated, so simultaneous data transfers are not possible.
<P>
The IDE bus can be used for IDE hard disks and for AT Attachment (ATA) Packet Interface (ATAPI) CD-ROMs.
<P>
An external PCI interrupt is not used.  Instead, the two internal interrups for the primary and secondary channels are routed to internal ISA interrups IRQ14 and IRQ15/
