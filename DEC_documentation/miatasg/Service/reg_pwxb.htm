The Window Base Register (WBR) provides the base address for a particular target window.  
There are four WBRs: W_BASE[0], W_BASE[1], W_BASE[2], and W_BASE[3].
The W_BASE[x] registers should not be modified unless software insures that no 
PCI traffic is targeted for the window being modified.<P>
Determining a Hit in the Target Window:

<UL>
<LI>The incoming PCI address bits &lt;31:20&gt; are compared with the each of the four 
WBRs, where the W_MASK register determines which bits are 
involved in the comparison.
<LI>The Target Window is "Hit" when the masked addresses match a valid WBRs.  If MEMCS_enable is set, then the "Hit" is further qualified by the MEMCS 
input signal -- this is used if PC compatibility holes are required in the PYXIS.
<LI>When DAC enable is set in Window 3, then W_DAC base register is used to compare PCI address&lt;39:32&gt; of a DAC cycle.
</UL>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>W_BASE</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;31:20&gt;RW</TD>
<TD>W_BASE specifies the PCI base address of the PCI Target Window and is 
used to determine a hit in the window.  See MCES_ENABLE and DAC_ENABLE also.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Reserved</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;19:4&gt;RO</TD>
<TD>N/A</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>DAC_<BR>ENABLE</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;3&gt;RW</TD>
<TD>When the DAC_ENABLE bit is set, then the W_DAC register is compared against 
PCI address&lt;39:32&gt; for a PCI DAC cycle.  If this compare "Hits," and the 32-bit portion of the PCI address "Hits," then a DAC cycle "Hit" occurs.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>MEMCS_EN (only in W0_BASE)</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;2&gt;RW</TD>
<TD>When the MEMCS_EN bit is set then the MEMCS signal from the PCI ISA or 
PCI EISA bridge is ANDed with the normal window "Hit."</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Wx_BASE<BR>_SG</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;1&gt;RW</TD>
<TD>When the Scatter/Gather bit is cleared, the PCI Target Window uses direct mapping to 
translate a PCI address to a CPU address.   When the SG bit is set, the PCI Target Window uses Scatter/Gather mapping to translate a PCI address to a physical memory address.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>W_EN</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&lt;0&gt;RW</TD>
<TD>When W_EN is cleared, the PCI Target Window is disabled and 
will not be used to respond to PCI-initiated transfers.  When W_EN is set, the PCI Target Window is enabled and will be used to respond to PCI-initiated transfers that "Hit" in the address range of the Target Window.</TD></TR>
