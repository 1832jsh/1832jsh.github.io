<h3>AlphaBIOS Initialization</H3>

<P>AlphaBIOS is a program used to help initialize and configure the Personal 
Workstation <EM>a-Series</EM> system. The AlphaBIOS
code resides in the system flashROM.</P>

<P>When the system is powered on, and POST finishes its tasks, AlphaBIOS is loaded and
started.  AlphaBIOS continues the system-initialization process by initializing the I/O 
system. This includes the PCI bus and connected devices such as SCSI disk controllers, 
video display controller, floppy drive, and keyboard.</P>

<P>The video and keyboard devices are initialized first. If either the keyboard or the video 
device is not present or not functioning, AlphaBIOS directs its output to the COM1 
serial port. This feature exists primarily to support the manufacturing process for the 
computer, but you may find it useful during the troubleshooting process. 
If AlphaBIOS does not start on your computer, first check that the keyboard is plugged in 
and  operational.  Ensure that the video card and monitor are 
properly connected and working. </P>

<P>
After the video and keyboard are initialized, AlphaBIOS displays a windowed, 
graphical-style user interface. As initialization continues, progress is displayed 
on the screen.</P>

<P>Next, memory is tested. While running, the memory test 
shows its progress for each megabyte (MB) of memory tested. 
Memory testing can be disabled at the Advanced CMOS Setup screen.
You can also cancel the memory test while it is running by pressing 
the spacebar.</P>

<P>After memory is tested, AlphaBIOS detects and initializes SCSI disk controllers connected
to the system. AlphaBIOS probes each controller's SCSI bus and reports 
each of the detected devices.</P>

<P>Finally, after the SCSI initialization is complete, AlphaBIOS closes the initialization 
window and displays the boot screen. The boot screen lists each of the operating systems that 
have been set up on the system. Boot by choosing the desired operating system. </P>

<H3>How a Windows NT Boot Starts</H3>

<P>AlphaBIOS boots Windows NT in two stages. The first stage involves reading an OS 
Loader program from a disk (OSLOADER.EXE).  
The selection parameters for the operating system must describe the 
path AlphaBIOS uses to find OSLOADER.EXE. The OS Loader program 
must be located in a FAT-formatted partition.</P>

<P>Once the OS Loader program executes, it uses the services provided by AlphaBIOS to 
load the operating system components. After the operating system is loaded, the OS 
Loader starts execution of the operating system.</P>
