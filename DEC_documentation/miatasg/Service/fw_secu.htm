<h3>AlphaBIOS Security</H3>

<P>
Password protection provides two levels of security for your system: 
<STRONG>setup protection</STRONG> 
and <STRONG>startup protection.</STRONG> When system setup protection is enabled, 
a password is required to start AlphaBIOS Setup. When startup password protection is enabled, a password is required before the system initializes.</P>

<P>Startup password protection provides more comprehensive protection than setup 
password protection because the system cannot be used at all until the correct 
password is entered.</P>

To enable password protection:
<OL>
<LI>Start AlphaBIOS Setup, select CMOS Setup, and press [Enter].
<LI>In the CMOS Setup screen, press [F6] to enter Advanced CMOS Setup.
<LI>In the Advanced CMOS Setup screen, select AlphaBIOS Password Option and use 
the arrow keys to select the type of protection you want. An explanatory dialog box 
appears. Read the dialog box and press [Enter] to continue.
<LI>Enter your password in the Enter New Password dialog box, and then press [Enter].
<LI>Enter your password in the Confirm New Password dialog box, and then press [Enter].
<LI>Press [F10] to save your changes.
</OL>


<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>	If you want to change your password, simply set up 
your password again.
