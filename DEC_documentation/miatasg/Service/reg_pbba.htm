Each memory bank has a corresponding base address register. The bits in this register 
are compared with the incoming sysAdr to determine the bank being addressed. The 
contents of this register are validated by setting the valid bit in the configuration register of that bank.
<P>
The base address of each bank must begin on a naturally aligned boundary. 
(So, for a bank with 2 to the <EM>n</EM> addresses, the<EM> n</EM> least significant bits must be zero.)
