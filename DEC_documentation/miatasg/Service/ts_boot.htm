<h3>Boot Troubleshooting</H3>

<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=100%>
<TR><TH>Possible Cause</TH><TH>Action</TH></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD VALIGN=TOP>Will not boot from an IDE hard disk drive.</TD>
<TD><EM>DIGITAL UNIX</EM>: Not supported.<BR>
</TD></TR>
	
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD VALIGN=TOP>Operating system (OS) software is not installed on the hard disk drive.</TD>
<TD>Install the operating system.</TD></TR>
	
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>Target boot device is not listed in the show device or show config (SRM) because of a SCSI bus problem.</TD>
<TD>Check the cables.  Are the cables oriented properly and not cocked?
Are there bent pins? Check all the SCSI devices for incorrect or conflicting IDs.  
Refer to the device's documentation.<BR>
SCSI termination: The SCSI bus must be terminated 
at the end of the internal cable AND at the last external SCSI peripheral. </TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD VALIGN=TOP>System cannot find the boot device.</TD>
<TD>Check the system configuration for correct device parameters. Use SRM 
firmware to display the hardware configuration. <BR>
<EM>DIGITAL UNIX</EM>: Use the SRM show config and show device 
commands.  Use the displayed information to identify target devices for the 
boot command, and verify that the system sees all of the installed devices.  
If you are attempting to use bootp, first set the following variables as shown:<BR>
<STRONG>>>>set ewa0_inet_init BOOTP</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>>>>set ewa0_protocols BOOTP</STRONG><BR>
</TD></TR>
	
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD VALIGN=TOP>Environment variables incorrectly set.  (This could happen if the MLB has been replaced, which would cause a loss of the previous configuration information). 
Configuration information is stored in the flashROM and RTC memory on the MLB. 
If the MLB is replaced, the information in the flashROM and realtime clock is lost.  
If the battery is replaced, the information in RTC memory is lost.  Keeping records of the 
configuration (IRQs, DMAs, I/O addresses, and so forth) will facilitate getting the system 
back into use.</TD>
<TD>Check and set the environment variables, if necessary. <BR>
<EM>DIGITAL UNIX</EM>: Use the SRM console show and set commands to check and 
set the values assigned to boot-related variables such as auto_action, bootdef_dev, and 
boot_osflag.<BR>
</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD VALIGN=TOP>Bad device name/number or partition number...</TD>
<TD>The <STRONG>system partition</STRONG> value is pointing to an invalid partition. 
From the AlphaBIOS Setup screen, 
select Utilities and OS Selection Setup.  Press [F9] to validate the selection.  
To edit the selection, press F6.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD VALIGN=TOP>File is not a directory..., or No such file or directory...</TD>
<TD>The <STRONG>osloader</STRONG> value is incorrect.  The <STRONG>system partition</STRONG> value is okay.  From the AlphaBIOS Setup screen, select Utility then OS Selection Setup.  Press [F9] to validate the selection.  To edit the selection, press [F6].</TD></TR>
	
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD VALIGN=TOP>Hard disk drive is not correctly formatted or the requested partition does not exist.</TD>
<TD>Format the hard disk drive or correctly partition the hard disk drive using
 appropriate tools (for example, Hard Disk Setup under AlphaBIOS). </TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD VALIGN=TOP>There is no software on the requested partition.</TD>
<TD>If the command is pointing to the correct partition, install the software.  Otherwise, change the variables to point to the correct partition.</TD></TR>
