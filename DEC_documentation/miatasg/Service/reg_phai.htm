This HAE_IO Hardware Address Extension Register is used to extend a PCI Sparse-space I/O address up to the full 32-bit PCI address. In Sparse Addressing mode, the CPU address provides the PCI addresses up to bit<24> and HAE_IO provides bits&lt;31:25&gt;.  On power-up, this register is set to zero (0). In this case, Sparse I/O region A and region B both map to the lower 32 MB of sparse IO space. Setting HAE_IO to 0x200.0000 will make region A and region B consecutive in the lower 64 MB of PCI IO space.
