The PERF_MONITOR CSR is really two 16-bit counters that can be programmed 
to count a variety of events. Setting up the counters is done through the 
PERF_CONTROL CSR. Each counter can be programmed to count events 
such as EV56 Read Misses received by PYXIS or DMA Writes. The 
PERF_MONITOR can also be set up as a single 32-bit counter (by telling 
the high_count to count the low_counter overflow).</TD></TR>
