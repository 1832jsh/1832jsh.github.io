The PYXIS Revision Register (PYXIS_REV) contains the PYXIS revision.  This field is 
monotonically increasing in order.  The field will be updated for each revision of the 
PYXIS ASIC. The PYXIS_ID can be used by software to dynamically determine if the 
device is a PYXIS or a CIA or other type of device that has similar functionality.  Software can then change the behavior of the system based on this information.</TD></TR>
