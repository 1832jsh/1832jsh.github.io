<H3>Memory Configuration</H3>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/membanks.gif" ALT="Memory Banks" HEIGHT=125 WIDTH=362 ALIGN=LEFT>The DIGITAL Personal Workstation <EM>a/au-Series</EM> system supports up to three banks of memory. Each
bank contains two <EM>identical</EM> DIMMs. To ensure
a match, the POST (power on self test) code use the I2C bus to read the characteristics of  each DIMM from a ROM on the DIMM. If identical pairs are not installed, the POST code may reject the DIMMs and flag the memory as unavailable.</P>
<P>
Memory banks can be populated in any order. The POST code automatically maps the
largest banks to the lowest addresses starting at <TT>00.0000.0000</TT>.
This prevents holes in the memory address space. </P>
