<h1>IBM 5150 Inspired PC</h1>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>For many years I have wanted to acquire a IBM 5150 Personal Computer, however their increasing price has made them more unattainable in the last few years. So, I decided to build my own PC in the style of the IBM 5150.</p>
<h4>Project Goals</h4>
<ol>
<li>Have a similar appearance to an IBM 5150</li>
<li>Allow the use of hardware in the case</li>
<li>Have enough space for a double height IBM LTO-3 drive</li>
<li>Have front panel power and reset buttons</li>
<li>Have front panel USB 3.0 ports</li>
<li>Contain 3.5" floppy drive</li>
</ol>
<h3>Designing the Front Panel</h3>
<p>The front panel of the 5150 is by far its most iconic element, thus extra attention to detail was given to this piece in order to ensure that it looks the part.</p>
<p>The design of the front panel started off with creating a 2D representation of the panel from reference photos found online, as pictured below.</p>

<p>Next, with side profile photos and measurements provided by a few retro computer enthusiasts , I was able to create a 3D front panel from the earlier 2D model. A few changes were made in this step to further improve the accuracy of the model, such as repositioning the badge, filleting the front edges, and creating a slight chamfer on the base, which can be seen on the image below.</p>

<p>Due to the build area constraints of my 3D printer, the model had to be broken up into four major pieces, with dog bone connectors to attach the pieces together. Additionally, the area behind the vent was mostly hollowed out to reduce plastic usage and 4mm mounting holes were embedded into the rear of the model.</p>
