<h1>IBM 5150 Inspired PC</h1>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>For many years I have wanted to acquire a IBM 5150 Personal Computer, however their increasing price has made them more unattainable in the last few years. So, I decided to build my own PC in the style of the IBM 5150.</p>
<h4>Project Goals</h4>
<ol>
<li>Have a similar appearance to an IBM 5150</li>
<li>Allow the use of hardware in the case</li>
<li>Have enough space for a double height IBM LTO-3 drive</li>
<li>Have front panel power and reset buttons</li>
<li>Have front panel USB 3.0 ports</li>
<li>Contain 3.5" floppy drive</li>
</ol>
